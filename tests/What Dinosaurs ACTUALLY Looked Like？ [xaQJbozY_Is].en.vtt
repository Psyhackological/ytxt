00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.179
The past is a vast and mysterious land that
begins at the big bang and ends in the present,

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.820
expanding with each passing moment.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.309
It is the home of everything that came before,
the key to understanding our present.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.439
Here we find the most amazing creatures to
ever roam our planet, hundreds of millions

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.560
of species so diverse that our imagination
cannot do them justice.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.009
Unfortunately the past carefully guards its
secrets.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.000
While there are a lot of things about the
past we know, there are way more things we

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.660
know we don’t know.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.590
And worse, there are probably even more things
we don’t even know that we don’t know

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:50.330
about.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.980
Think of the wonder of life: We now recognize
about 1.5 million eukaryotic species but there

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.660
may be as many as 10 million alive today.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.760
And although we are adding some 15,000 new
species to our collective knowledge each year,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.660
the vast majority of life on earth is still
undiscovered.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.700
This is just what is around today.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.260
An estimated four billion species emerged
on our planet in past eons.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.770
But at least 99% of them died out, way before
humans spoke the first words.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.500
The vast majority of all the different species
that ever existed are so utterly deleted that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.890
they have become part of the “unknown unknown”
part of the past, lost to us forever.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.950
Or are they?

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.700
Could we use science and imagination to glimpse
a shadow of the unreachable past?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.460
Let us start with what we DO know.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.410
To learn about creatures of the past we need
fossils, any sort of remains preserved from

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.210
past geological ages – bones or shells,
impressions or imprints, things preserved

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.000
in amber.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.810
The totality of all fossils on earth is called
the fossil record and it is the most important

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.899
window on the past we’ll ever have.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.840
For a dead animal to fossilize a number of
things must go just right: The right environment,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.000
timing and conditions.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.319
And then the fossil needs to survive for millions
or hundreds of millions of years and then

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.090
get back to the surface – and then be discovered
before natural processes dissolve it.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.409
So it is kind of a miracle that we have what
we have and know what we know.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.819
Take the dinosaurs since they were one of
the largest and most successful groups of

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.800
animals for some 165 million years – and
are also a lot of fun to animate.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.530
What were they really like and what are we
missing?

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.010
In the last 200 years we’ve found tens of
thousands of fossils from over 1000 dinosaur

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.010
species..

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.129
Lately we’ve entered a golden era of discovery
and about 50 new dinosaur species are discovered

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.020
each year, expanding what we know and what
we know that we don’t know about them, which

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.020
is amazing.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.700
But it also makes us aware of all the things
lost to the past forever.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.049
Imagine if we took all the animals that lived
in the last 50 million years and randomly

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.480
chose 10000 individuals from 1000 species
to fossilize.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.250
Think about all the things that would be missed,
or that seem too weird to be true.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.689
Like the Giraffe, a yellow animal with brown
patterns that looks like a horse and an antelope

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.999
had a baby, with a long neck and two tiny
hairy horns.

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.430
How many “dinosaur giraffes” were there?

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.980
Animals so weird and selected for ecological
niches so specific that evolution molded their

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.129
bodies very absurdly - today they might seem
made up to us..

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.200
We know a lot of species are lost forever
just because of the environment they lived

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200
in.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.980
For example, lush jungles basically prevent
fossilization as the chances that an animal

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.499
will be buried here is minimal.

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.319
Countless scavengers of all sizes break down
freshly deceased animals extremely quickly

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.310
and the soil is often so acidic that bones
are dissolved.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.160
And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are
practically nonexistent.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.220
Today half of all known species live in the
few remaining rainforests that only cover

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.070
2% of earth's landmass.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.840
Millions of years ago when dinosaurs roamed
earth, jungles covered much more of the planet.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.730
So besides some insects and other small animals
trapped in amber, there should be millions

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.370
of species that emerged and vanished, without
leaving any trace.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.130
Trapped deep inside the unknown, unknown.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.080
But just in general biology trips us up.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080
Look at your body.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.060
It’s mainly squishy, gooey, soft stuff.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.670
Which does not preserve well.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.130
What remains the longest are the crystalized
parts of your bones and so most dinosaur fossils

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.590
are bones or teeth – usually fragments,
not entire skeletons.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.470
This means that almost all boneless or shell-less
animals are practically wiped from the fossil

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.780
record.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.500
If we take a look at the stunning diversity
of weird animals like worms, jellyfish and

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.940
slugs alive today we can only speculate what
we are missing.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.000
Although thankfully many mostly soft and gooey
species also left us an incredible diversity

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.150
of shells that tell us an amazing amount about
our past, so at least we have that.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.870
Still when we think about all the boneless
species that may have existed in the last

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.400
half billion years even our best attempt at
imagining them falls short.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.770
But it's not like reimagining something based
on its bones is straightforward and so the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.640
way we envisage what dinosaurs actually looked
like has changed a lot in the last few years.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.090
In the past many illustrations had a bony,
minimalistic look, with a toothy grin to signify

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.420
fierceness and danger.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.090
But if we draw today's animals in a similar
way, based on their skeletons, just for the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.100
fun of it, we get the most bizarre creatures.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.550
Elephants, swans and baboons that look like
monsters right out of nightmares.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.040
So similar to animals today, we should imagine
dinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fat

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.070
bellies or chests, weird soft parts like skin
flaps, lips and gums and just more pronounced

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.530
features that would make them seem like much
more pleasant fellows.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.980
Some soft features actually leave distinctive
traces on bones that we can look for in the

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.950
skeletons of extinct animals, which is where
today’s animals with similar features are

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.140
really helpful.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.690
It’s a similar story with color.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.400
Because we know what the feathers of living
birds look like, modern technology combined

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.060
with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved
remains of fuzzy feathers give us a glimpse

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.690
of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:58.170
We know that tiny Sinosauropteryx had a striped
tail and its tiny dino buddy Anchiornis huxleyi

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.260
was white and black with gorgeous red feathers
around its head.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.590
Still, for the vast majority of really any
ancient extinct species we have no real clue

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.520
what color they were.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.920
But we know what modern dinosaurs, birds,
look like and here we find the most amazing

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.690
variety.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.870
So some dinosaurs will have tried to blend
into the background, while others might have

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.870
fielded aggressive color schemes to attract
mates or to appear dangerous.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.680
Some might have had impressive decorations
or colorful beaks.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.770
Some may have been striped or patterned.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.930
Similarly we don’t know that much about
dinosaur behaviour, although once again we

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.590
can draw conclusions from existing animals.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.720
For example even apex predators like lions
spend a lot of their time lying around and

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.810
cuddling and licking each other and playing.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.810
Why would dinosaurs be so different?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.720
When we first found the skull of T. rex with
its mighty teeth and probably the strongest

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.060
bite of any land animal ever, we imagined
a fierce and stupid beast.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.620
But modern scanning technology has revealed
that T.rex had a larger brain-to-body ratio

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.400
than some earlier giant meat-eaters.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.940
And it probably had very sharp hearing, vision
and sense of smell and was in all likelihood

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.370
not a stupid animal.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.170
So maybe T.rex was a cuddly fellow that spent
a lot of time playing around or impressing

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.020
potential mates when it was not hungry.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.670
Likewise, while their horns and shields might
have made ceratopsids appear to be natural

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.500
born fighters, they were probably much more
than that.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.330
Based on the behaviour of modern animals and
the complex dances some have to go through

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:40.129
to mate, maybe their shields were amazingly
colorful, maybe it danced for its mates like

00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:42.380
many birds do today.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.660
How intensely amazing these creatures must
have been.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.800
And what a loss it is to us that we don’t
get to experience them first hand.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.000
What an even greater loss that there is so
much we will never know about them and even

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.060
more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful
beings that disappeared without a trace.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:07.810
But such is life – time marches on without
any concern for our feelings and the past

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.310
expands with every moment that passes.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.620
Most wild animals alive today will in all
likelihood not leave fossils behind and also

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.410
just disappear forever.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.449
We can do something about that though – instead
of accelerating the extinction we are witnessing

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:28.999
we could become the guardians of life and
preserve it where we find it.

00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:34.870
If possible in the wild, if not then in museums,
movies and in our minds.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.470
Because as amazing as our imagination is,
and as fascinating to think about the animals

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:45.510
that are part of the unknown unknown – it
is even better to witness them in the present.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:54.670
The land that we actually inhabit, where we
get to experience life as it happens.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:10:00.940
There is one more exciting way to experience
Dinosaurs though this year: The 12,022 Human

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.699
Era Calendar: Eons Edition.

00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:07.820
As always, we’re adding 10,000 years to
the regular calendar to represent the Human

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.860
Era and include all cultures around the world.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.570
But this year we’re expanding the scope
beyond humanity to showcase forgotten animals

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.870
and plants from all across the Phanerozoic
Eon, like giant armoured fish, scythe lizards

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.990
or giant sloths, on 12 elaborate pages.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.949
Witness how multicellular life has persisted
for over half a billion years, surviving asteroid

00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:32.870
impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.050
And of course, pandemics.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:41.730
In the end life, uh, finds a way – and we
want to celebrate that!

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.310
You can get the very shiny, high-quality,
limited Edition now until we sell out and

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.889
then never again.

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:51.800
To support what we do on this channel, to
fill the void in your soul or just to have

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.200
something beautiful to look at.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.940
As every year, we also have bundles and special
calendar deals with some of your favorite

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.300
products.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:06.889
Thank you so much to all of the thousands
of birbs who get the calendar every year,

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:11.540
you enable us to create videos and to publish
them for free, for everyone.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:27.660
We wish you a happy year 12,022.
