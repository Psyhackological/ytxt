00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.680
You are not a person, you are a planet,&nbsp;
made of roughly 40 trillion cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.040
There is so much of you, that&nbsp;
if your cells were human-sized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.000
you would be as big as 20 Mount Everests. For your&nbsp;
creepy-crawly inhabitants, this makes your body an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.720
ecosystem, rich in resources and warmth and space.&nbsp;
A perfect place to move into and have a family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.160
While some of these guests are welcome, most&nbsp;
are not. Your immune system is the guardian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.680
of this planet, the force tasked with protecting&nbsp;
yourself against the constant danger of invasion.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.840
Unfortunately your enemies in the&nbsp;
tiny world have a huge advantage.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.320
Consider the effort it takes to make a single copy&nbsp;
of yourself and your trillions of cells. First you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.240
need to find someone who thinks you are cute,&nbsp;
date and be awkward and if things work out in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.080
complicated dance, two of your cells merge&nbsp;
together. Then you need to wait for months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.040
while the cell multiplies over and over until&nbsp;
it is released into the world as a human being.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.960
And even then you only have a mini copy&nbsp;
that needs years to become remotely useful.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.680
A bacterium consists of one cell. It can make&nbsp;
a fully grown copy in about half an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.800
A virus can turn into hundreds within&nbsp;
hours and billions within days.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.000
Your enemies multiply orders&nbsp;
of magnitude faster than you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.240
Even worse, for a bacterium or virus&nbsp;
your body is a hostile ecosystem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.400
applying selective pressure. Because they go&nbsp;
through so many generations so quickly, eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.680
by pure chance, there will be an individual&nbsp;
that mutates and adapts in just the right way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.240
to resist your defenses and then multiply quickly&nbsp;
again. In other words, you are facing a sheer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.040
endless variety of different enemies and you’re&nbsp;
too slow to keep up with their evolution.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.640
This is bad.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.680
Luckily your immune system is just about&nbsp;
the most amazing thing ever. The second most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.840
complex biological system known to us, after the&nbsp;
human brain, and so sophisticated that we still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.080
haven’t discovered all its secrets. Since it is&nbsp;
so complicated we have to simplify and focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.360
one thing at a time. If you want the full story,&nbsp;
wait for the announcement at the end of the video!

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.680
Ok, so why are we not all killed by some&nbsp;
new bacteria or virus? In a nutshell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.800
you actually have two immune systems, the&nbsp;
innate and the adaptive immune system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.320
The innate immune system was&nbsp;
ready when you were born.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.920
It mostly consists of general purpose soldiers,&nbsp;
we introduced them in the last immune video.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.560
The adaptive immune system carries two types of&nbsp;
cells T Cells and B Cells that are your super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.960
weapons and are incredibly effective and deadly&nbsp;
for your enemies. These cells are complicated to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.080
produce and take a lot of time to deploy but&nbsp;
once they are ready, they pack a real punch.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.920
What makes your adaptive immune system&nbsp;
so powerful is that it has the largest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.680
library in the universe. It has an answer to&nbsp;
everything. You have at least one of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.880
super weapon cells inside you to fight the&nbsp;
black death, the corona virus and the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.080
deadly bacteria that will emerge in a city&nbsp;
on Mars in one hundred years. This makes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.200
possible for you to counter the ability of&nbsp;
bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.440
How is this possible? To understand what is&nbsp;
going on here, we need to take one step back.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.920
All organisms on earth are&nbsp;
made from the same basic parts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.000
mostly proteins. Proteins are&nbsp;
the building blocks of life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.880
and can have billions of different shapes&nbsp;
- you can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.160
There are billions of different puzzle pieces&nbsp;
your enemies can use to construct their bodies.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.960
Why is this important? Because proteins are&nbsp;
in a way the “language” of the microworld.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.600
Cells don’t have eyes or ears, so to tell friend&nbsp;
from foe, they have to touch them and recognize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.760
if their protein is part of a friend or part of an&nbsp;
enemy. Recognizing means that cells have countless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.720
tiny devices called receptors, that are able to&nbsp;
connect with a specific protein puzzle piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.000
So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their&nbsp;
outsides that are able to click together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.520
or recognize other protein puzzle pieces.&nbsp;
When a cell connects together with a protein&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.840
and recognizes it as “enemy”,&nbsp;
it knows that it has to attack.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.480
Only if your cells can make this&nbsp;
distinction between friend or foe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.120
is your immune system able to fight an invader.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.960
But since there are billions of&nbsp;
possible protein puzzle pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.720
this means there are billions of possible enemy&nbsp;
puzzle pieces. This is also one of the reasons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.360
we still have to deal with diseases like the&nbsp;
flu each year – the influenza virus mutates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.000
very rapidly and so the proteins that make&nbsp;
up its hull constantly change a tiny bit.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.280
The soldiers of your innate immune system have&nbsp;
a large number of the puzzle pieces for common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.120
bacteria and viruses memorized, that’s why&nbsp;
they are your all purpose weapons. But they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.960
ineffective against many billions of mutations&nbsp;
and adaptations that your enemies can develop.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.800
So the reason you are still alive is that your&nbsp;
Adaptive immune system is able to recognize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.160
between one billion and ten billion different&nbsp;
enemy protein puzzle pieces, which is enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.520
to be prepared for every possible enemy. But&nbsp;
how is this possible? How could your immune&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.040
system possibly have this much of a variety to be&nbsp;
prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.760
Well, the cells of your adaptive immune system&nbsp;
found a cheat code: mixing and matching their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.680
genetic code to create this stunning variety of&nbsp;
receptors. The details are way too complicated for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.040
this video but in a nutshell, your adaptive immune&nbsp;
cells have official permission to take a tiny part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.640
of their own genetic code and mix it in random&nbsp;
ways to create billions of different receptors.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.920
A good way to explain this is by asking&nbsp;
you to imagine an army of cooks, with each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.360
of them wanting their own special recipe. They&nbsp;
have 100 different ingredients to choose from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.400
Each ingredient stands for one tiny&nbsp;
piece of genetic code in this metaphor.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.240
So each cook takes a few random ingredients&nbsp;
and randomly mixes them together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.240
Maybe Tomato, Chicken, Rice&nbsp;
and half an onion as entree,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.920
Marshmallow, Pepper, Strawberries&nbsp;
and a quarter banana as a dessert.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.600
Or Cucumber, Beef, Potatoes and two carrots,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.480
and blueberries, chocolate and&nbsp;
cream with a pinch of cinnamon.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.200
Even with slight variation&nbsp;
and with only 100 ingredients,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.400
there are billions of possible recipes.&nbsp;
And likewise, with just a small selection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.320
of gene fragments, your cells create billions&nbsp;
of receptors. The details of this are so cool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.440
that they should get their own video – or&nbsp;
their own chapter in a book. In any case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.520
by mixing up gene fragments, you get up to ten&nbsp;
billion different combinations. So in the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.440
you get billions of immune cells, and each of&nbsp;
them has one specific and unique receptor – the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.000
dish from our metaphor – that is able to&nbsp;
recognize one specific protein puzzle piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.320
In total, you end up with at least one cell&nbsp;
for every enemy that could possibly exist.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.440
But here we run into a pretty dangerous problem&nbsp;
– if your adaptive immune system is making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.200
weapons that can attack every possible&nbsp;
protein puzzle piece in the universe…&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.960
wouldn’t it also make some that can attack&nbsp;
your own cells? Yes, it happens all the time.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.520
This is so fundamentally dangerous to&nbsp;
your survival that you have a whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.360
organ that does nothing but work on preventing&nbsp;
this: The Murder University of your Thymus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.040
Your Thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above&nbsp;
your heart and you've probably never heard of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.640
it. Interestingly, your thymus is one of the&nbsp;
reasons why your immune system weakens as you age,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.080
because it is in a constant state of decline once&nbsp;
you reach puberty. But what does the Thymus do?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.920
In your murder university, your immune&nbsp;
system is putting your adaptive immune cells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.280
through an intense and deadly curriculum.&nbsp;
Basically it is showing them all sorts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.120
protein puzzle pieces that are used by&nbsp;
your own cells to see how they react.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.440
When a young cell recognizes a body puzzle piece&nbsp;
and wants to attack it, the teacher cells order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:40.080
them to kill themselves and they are eaten up&nbsp;
and recycled. The immune system is so particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.320
about this process that around 98% of your&nbsp;
adaptive immune cells that enter murder university&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.680
die there. 2% graduate and get to do&nbsp;
their job of protecting you for real.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.840
If this process goes wrong and cells escape that&nbsp;
can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.160
this can lead to autoimmune disease, where&nbsp;
your immune system attacks your own body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.480
from the inside. Andt this, again&nbsp;
is another story for another time.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.680
Ok, let us summarize. Your immune system has&nbsp;
two parts, one that defends you right after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.760
birth and one that carries the largest&nbsp;
library of superweapons in the universe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.440
but needs to boot up first. To create billions&nbsp;
of different superweapons, your adaptive immune&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.560
cells recombine a part of their genetic code to&nbsp;
create a breathtaking variety of attack weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.520
Then they enter a murder university that only 2%&nbsp;
survive to make sure they do not attack you. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.400
then you end up with billions of different cells,&nbsp;
that in total are able to protect you against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.000
every possible enemy in the universe.&nbsp;
Now wait a second. If this is all true,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.400
why do we get sick at all? Why was a new disease&nbsp;
like Covid-19 able to kill millions of people?

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.880
Well everything we just learned about is just a&nbsp;
tiny, tiny window into the amazing struggle for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.320
life and death that plays out every day inside&nbsp;
your body and there are so many amazing details&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.360
and questions here: How does your body actually&nbsp;
find the right cell in time to protect you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.680
How do your enemies fight back and&nbsp;
overcome your immune system anyway?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.840
And what about all the things&nbsp;
that did not fit in this video?

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:25.120
Well, today finally marks the release of “Immune&nbsp;
– A Journey Into the Mysterious System that Keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.080
You Alive”, written by Philipp Dettmer,&nbsp;
the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.760
First we had to push the release back&nbsp;
because of cargo trouble and then because so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.760
many of you pre-ordered that we didn’t have&nbsp;
enough copies for the original launch day!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.160
Thank you so, so much for that!

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.720
Immune tells the epic story of your&nbsp;
immune system and will forever change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.200
how you think about your own body, how&nbsp;
you experience being sick and healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.320
The book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp&nbsp;
as Kurzgesagt videos but it is able to dive way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.040
deeper iinto its subject. So go on a journey&nbsp;
through the hidden microverse within yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.360
Witness deadly wars between billions of invaders&nbsp;
and cells, learn how your immune system actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.760
works and protects you from cuts, cancer and&nbsp;
Covid. Never before have we so urgently needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:18.400
to learn about how immunity works. Immune is fun&nbsp;
and great to look at and it even smells good.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.280
Follow the link in the&nbsp;
description to order it today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.680
This is the end of a decade-long&nbsp;
personal journey working on this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:41.840
thank you all so, so much for your support.&nbsp;
And thank you for watching. And reading.
