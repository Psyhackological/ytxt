00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.720
You were on your way home, when you died.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.200
It was a car accident.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.200
Nothing particularly remarkable.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.160
But fatal, none the less.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.260
It was a painless death.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.440
The medics tried their best to save you... but to no avail.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.560
Your body was so utterly shattered, you were better off. Trust me.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.265
And that's when you met me.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.405
What happened?

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:31.255
Where am I?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.619
You died.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.892
I said, matter of factly.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.340
No point in mincing words.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.120
There was... there was a truck.

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:41.740
And it was skidding.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.140
Yes.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.760
I... I died?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.420
Yes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.740
But don't feel bad about it.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.683
Everyone dies.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.379
You looked around.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.860
There was... nothingness.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.020
Just you, and me.

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:01.080
What is this place?

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.295
Is this, the afterlife?

00:01:04.783 --> 00:01:06.000
More or less.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.400
Are you... God?

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:09.920
Yes.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.175
I'm God.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.300
My kids...

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.860
My wife...

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.035
What about them?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.100
Will they be alright?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.269
"That's what I like to see," I said.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.228
You just died, and your main concern is for your family.

00:01:27.228 --> 00:01:29.340
That's good stuff right there.

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:32.460
You looked at me with fascination.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.429
To you, I didn't look like God.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.848
I just looked like some man, or possibly a woman.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.420
Some vague authority figure maybe.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.760
"Don't worry," I said.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.100
They'll be fine.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.620
Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.360
They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.340
Your wife will cry on the outside.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.500
But will be secretly relieved.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.840
To be fair, your marriage was falling apart.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.580
If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.060
Oh...

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.160
So what happens now?

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.700
Do I go to Heaven? Or Hell or something?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.000
Neither.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.600
You'll be reincarnated.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.460
Ah...

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.560
So the Hindus were right!

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.340
All religions are right in their own way.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.320
Walk with me.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.920
You followed along as we strolled through the void.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.440
Where are we going?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.760
No where in particular.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.720
It's just nice to walk while we talk.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.160
So, what's the point then?

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.580
When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate right?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.260
A baby?

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.700
So, all my experiences and everything... everything I did in this life...

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.540
Won't matter...

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.420
Not so.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.500
You have within you, all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.780
You just don't remember them right now.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.000
I stopped walking, and took you by the shoulders.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.300
Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.380
A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.920
It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.520
To see if it's hot or cold.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.880
You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.500
You've been in a human for the last 48 years.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.360
So you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.360
If we hung out here for long enough, you'd start remembering everything.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.280
But there's not point to doing that between each life.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.460
How many times have I been reincarnated then?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800
Oh, lots! Lots and lots!

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.300
And into lots of different lives.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.540
This time around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 A.D.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.620
Wait... what?!

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.980
You're sending me back in time?

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.040
Well I guess technically.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.900
Time as you know it, only exists in your universe.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.060
Things are different where I come from.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.300
Where... where you come from?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.620
Oh sure, I come from somewhere. Somewhere else.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.800
And there are others like me.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.700
I know you'll want to know what it's like there but honestly you wouldn't understand.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.900
"Oh..."

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.780
You said, a little let down.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.460
But wait...

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.220
If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.740
Sure, happens all the time.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.720
And with both lives only aware of their own lifespans, you don't even know it's happening.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.920
So...

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.583
what's the point of it all?

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.680
I looked you in the eye.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.911
The meaning of life,

00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:09.400
the reason I made this whole universe,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400
is for you to mature.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.860
You mean... mankind?

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.860
You want to us to mature?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.260
No, just you.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.888
I made this whole universe for you.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.600
With each new life

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.700
you grow and mature, and become a larger and greater intellect.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.000
Just me?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.240
What about everyone else?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.600
There is no one else.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.131
In this universe, there's just you and me.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.691
You stared blankly at me.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.906
But all the people on Earth...

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.511
All you.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.772
Different incarnations of you.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.260
Wait... I'm... everyone?

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.960
Now you're getting it.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.954
I'm every human being who ever lived?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.120
Or who will ever live,  yes.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.960
I'm Abraham Lincoln?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.200
And you're John Wilkes Booth too.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.780
I'm Hitler?!

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.166
You said appalled.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.880
And you're the millions he killed.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.880
I'm Jesus?!

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.180
And you're everyone who followed Him.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.260
You fell silent.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.091
Every time you victimized someone, you were victimizing yourself.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.740
Every act of kindness you have done, you have done to yourself.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.860
Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was or will be experienced by you.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.680
You thought for a long time.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.320
Why? Why do all this?

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.531
Because someday you will become like me.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.878
Because that's what you are!

00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:49.920
You're one of my kind.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.500
You're my child!

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.340
Wow!! You said incredulous.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.560
You mean I'm a God?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.663
No, not yet, you're a fetus.

00:07:01.663 --> 00:07:02.980
You're still growing.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.012
Once you've lived every human life throughout all time,

00:07:07.012 --> 00:07:09.560
you will have grown enough to be born.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.800
So the whole universe...

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.480
it's just...

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.211
an egg!

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.860
I answered:

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.789
now it's time for you to move on to your next life.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.067
And I sent you on your way.
